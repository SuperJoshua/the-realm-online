# A map of The Realm Online
Despothes Grove, server 3.52

The Realm Online is an MMORPG that's offered in both pay-to-play and free-to-play versions -- Mabon's Gamble and Despothes's Grove, respectively -- both of which can be found on [the official site](https://www.realmserver.com/).

The map that I made can be seen live, [here, on GitHub](https://superjoshua.github.io/the-realm-online/).

It also exists on [Neocities](https://superjoshua.neocities.org/the_realm_online/), with some additional content.

I made considerable effort towards accuracy, but I recognize that error likely remains. There is certainly room for improvement. It's also outdated, and I believe that I've had my fill of this project.
