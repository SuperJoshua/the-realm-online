# A map of The Realm Online, Despothes Grove, server 3.52

The Realm Online is an MMORPG that's offered in both a pay-to-play version and a free-to-play version, namely, Mabon's Gamble and Despothes's Grove -- both of which can be found on [the official site](https://www.realmserver.com/).

The map can be seen, [here, on GitHub](https://superjoshua.github.io/the-realm-online/).

It also exists at [neocities.org](https://superjoshua.neocities.org/the_realm_online/), with some additional content.

I've made considerable effort towards accuracy, but I recognize that error likely remains. There is certainly room for improvement. I believe that I've had my fill of this project, and I've uploaded this so that another may continue it, unhindered, if so desired.
